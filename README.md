I have made a simple ER diagram of Student Database.
Here we 2 entities -> Student and Subject.
I have made a relationship and instantiated "Studies" and "Teaches" relationship.
The blue and green circles are the attributes associated with the entities.The green is the primary key.
The well formedness rules show that 
Student should be connected to a subject only via relationships like "Studies" or "Teaches".
