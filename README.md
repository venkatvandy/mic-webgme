I have made a simple ER diagram of Student Database.

Here we have 2 ENTITIES -> STUDENT and SUBJECT(Shown in pink boxes)

I have made a RELATIONSHIP and instantiated "Studies" and "Teaches" relationships.(Shown in orange boxes)

The BLUE and GREEN circles are the ATTRIBUTES associated with the ENTITIES.The GREEN signifies that it is the primary key.

The WELL FORMEDNESS rules show that
STUDENT should be connected to a SUBJECT only via RELATIONSHIPS like "Studies" or "Teaches".
Also we can see that the attributes can be connected to the respective attributes inside the entities and the primary key attribute can be connected to the primary key attribute inside the entity.
